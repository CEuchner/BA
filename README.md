# Data of Bachelor thesis

In this repository you find part of my work on my bachelor thesis.

In the folder ***MATLABfunctions*** are the functions for the radon-transform and the filtered backprojection implemented for my bachlor thesis. They have been used to compute the pictures in my bachelor thesis.

In the folder ***exercise*** is an exercise on the filtered backprojection including the needed MATLAB-functions and solutions. The matrix-data *sinogram.mat* and *data.mat* can't be uploaded.
